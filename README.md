# fine_tuning_samples
Learning fine tuning models is a multi-step process. Using set of notebooks / python codes, try to understand various aspects of fine-tuning. Topics to understand for fine tuning
1. PEFT (Performance efficient fine-tuning)
    1. Quantization
    2. LoRA (Lower Order Rank Adaption)
3. Understanding GPU / CPU / TPUs
4. Data Perperation (Instruction Set)
5. Fine Tuning
6. Evaluation


Note: This repo will evolve as I add more content increase my understanding of each aspects of fine tuning
